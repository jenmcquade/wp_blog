= New in Version 3.4 =

hashtagger now supports usage of the same hashtag in different languages in combination wit Polylang.

= #hashtags =

This plugin uses the [WordPress Tag system](http://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Tags_Screen) to field your post under the desired tags. When saving a post each [#hashtag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag) is added as a "normal" tag (without leading hash) to the post, so it is fully compatible with existing tags. 

When showing a post all #hashtags are automatically converted to links leading to the corresponding tag archive page.

**Caution:** It is not necessary to generally adapt existing posts, because their tags stay unchanged. But keep in mind that on saving a post all existing tas are **removed** and replaced by the tags found in your post! **This behavior can be changed in the Plugin Settings Area.**

= @usernames =

The usage of @usernames can be activated optionally. @usernames can link either to the Users Profile Page or to the Users Website. If the username does not exist the text remains unchanged and no link is created.

Optionally @nicknames can be used instead of @usernames. This is **recommended to enhance security** ([read more](http://petersplugins.com/wp-hashtagger/hashtagger-plugin-why-you-should-use-nicknames-instead-of-usernames/)). Although using @nicknames is the better option, the default is @usernames for compatibility to Plugin versions prior 2.1.

= $cashtags =

The usage of $cashtags can be activated optionally. $cashtags link to the concerning stock symbol at MarketWatch, Google Finance or Yahoo Finance.

Examples:

* [$GOOG](http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/Stock/GOOG) @ MarketWatch
* [$GOOG](https://www.google.com/finance?q=GOOG) @ Google Finance
* [$GOOG](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GOOG) @ Yahoo Finance

**Notice**: stock symbols can not be validated. Using a invalid stock symbol may cause an error on the target site.

= Usage =

Just type anywhere in a post

* **#hashtag** - This adds "hashtag" as tag to the current post and on links to tag archive page for "hashtag" when showing the post.
* **+#hashtag** - Use +#hashtag to only link to a tag archive page without adding "hashtag" as tag to the post. When showing the post the link is showed as "#hashtag" (without "+"). If the tag does not exist the text remains unchanged and no link is created.
* **##hashtag** - Use duplicate ##hashes to tell the plugin that this word should not be converted into a tag. Duplicate hashes are replaced by a single hash when showing the post.
* **@username** - This creates a link either to the Profile Page or the Website of User "username" (@username feature has to be activated).
* **@@username** - Use @@username to avoid link creation. When showing the post this is displayed as "@username" without link (@username feature has to be activated).
* **$cashtag** - This creates a link to the concerning stock symbol at MarketWatch, Google Finance or Yahoo Finance ($cashtag feature has to be activated).
* **$$chashtag** - Use $$cashtag to avoid link creation. When showing the post this is displayed as "$cashtag" without link ($cashtag feature has to be activated).

= WordPress Security =

**It is highly recommended to use @nicknames instead of @usernames!** Please read [this article](http://petersplugins.com/wp-hashtagger/hashtagger-plugin-why-you-should-use-nicknames-instead-of-usernames/)!

= Post Types and Section Types =

In the plugins Settings you can define where #hashtags and @usernames should be processed. It is possible to use them on Posts, on Pages and on Custom Post Types within Content, Title and Excerpt. Activate only the Post Types and Section Types you want to be processed to avoid unnecessary processing for best performance.

= Formatting links =

Additional CSS Class(es) to add to the #hashtag and @username links can be configured on the plugins setting page.

= Display of links in front end =

Optionally all symbols (#, @, $) can be removed from the links generated in front end.

= Theme function =

You can use `do_hashtagger( $content )` in your theme files to process #hashtags and @usernames in $content.

**Example:**
`<?php echo do_hashtagger( get_post_meta( get_the_ID(), 'mycustomfield', true ) ); ?>` 

= Translations =

As of version 3.4 the hashatgger Plugin uses GlotPress - the wordpress.org Translation System - for translations. Translations can be submitted at [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/hashtagger).

**Translations are highly appreciated**. It would be great if you'd support the hashtagger Plugin by adding a new translation or keeping an existing one up to date. If you're new to GlotPress take a look at the [Translator Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/tools/glotpress-translate-wordpress-org/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What characters can a hashtag include? =

The hashtag detection follows the rules for hashtags on Twitter, Facebook and Google+. The minimum length for a hashtag is 2 characters. A hashtag must not start with a number (this can be changed optionally). A hashtag not only ends at a space but also at punctuation marks and other special characters. A hashtag may contain underscores.

= Does this also work for pages? =

Yes and No. Yes - the plugin can add the tags also for pages. No - WordPress does not show the tags section for pages and also pages are not listed on tag archives. 

This plugin does not change this behavior of WordPress because there already exist several plugins that add the tag functionality for pages. Please use one of them if you want to tag your pages.

= How to change the Tag base? =

The Tag base for the Tag Archive Page URL (e.g. example.com/**tag**/anytag) can be set on the 'Permalink Settings' page under 'Tag base' in your WP admin.

= Where does @username link to? =

This can be set on hashtagger Settings Page. @username links can either link to the Users Profile Page or to the Users Webiste (Users Profile Page if no Webpage is set). When linking to Users Website the link can be opened in a new window if desired.

= Why should I use @nicknames instead of @usernames =

This is important to enhance WordPress security. Please read [this article](http://petersplugins.com/wp-hashtagger/hashtagger-plugin-why-you-should-use-nicknames-instead-of-usernames).

= Can I use #hashtags and/or @usernames in Excerpts? =

Yes, just activate this feature.

= Can I use #hashtags and/or @usernames in Titles? =

Yes, just activate this feature.

= Can I regenerate all existing Posts after changing Settings? =
